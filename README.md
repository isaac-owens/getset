## Features
GetSet allows users to create a list of photos as "scavenger hunt" items.  Once a list is completed, other users attempt to match each picture in the hunt list with their own photos, attempting to make the match as pixel perfect as possible.  The app returns a score of how accurately the picture matches the original and tallies a score.  Photo Hunts have an expiration date and upon expiration the results are posted to any user that participated in the hunt.  Winners photos are added to the landing page feed.  Users can comment on other photo challenges as well as save challenges they are currently finishing or already have finished.
